        <h2>1. YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES</h2>
        <p>No one under 13 is allowed to use or access the Services. We may offer additional Services that

                of residence to access and use the Services;</li>
            <li>You can form a binding contract with us, or, if you are over 13 but under the age of
                majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these
                Terms;</li>
            <li>You are not barred from using the Services under all applicable laws; and</li>
            <li>You have not been permanently suspended or removed from the Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or
            government entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these
            Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. PRIVACY</h2>
        <p><a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you
            access or use our Services. You understand that through your use of the Services, you consent to
            the collection and use of this information as set forth in the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES</h2>
        <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Mynewone grants you a personal,
            non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to: (a) install and use a copy of
            our mobile application associated with the Services that is obtained from a legitimate
            marketplace on a mobile device owned or controlled by you; and (b) access and use the Services.
            We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.</p>
        <p>Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may
            not, without our written agreement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the
                Services or Content;</li>
            <li>modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of
                the Services or Content; or</li>
            <li>access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product,
                or service, except as permitted under any Additional Terms (as defined below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are always improving our Services. This means we may add or remove features, products, or
            functionalities; we will try to notify you beforehand, but that won't always be possible. We
            reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any
            time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to
            functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to
            time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,
            suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.</p>

        <h2>4. YOUR ACCOUNT AND ACCOUNT SECURITY</h2>
        <p>To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Mynewone account (an
            "Account") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about
            yourself as set forth in the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the information associated with your Account and anything that
            happens related to your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and immediately
            notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your
            permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with your Account and
            enable two-factor authentication.</p>

        <h2>5. YOUR CONTENT</h2>
        <p>The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, audio, streams,
            software, tools, or other materials ("Content"), including Content created with or submitted to
            the Services by you or through your Account ("Your Content"). We take no responsibility for and
            we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness,
            accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.</p>
        <p>By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights,
            power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms.
            Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you
            post or share Content without all necessary rights.</p>

        <h2>6. THINGS YOU CAN NOT DO</h2>
