                    <p>Mynewone is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the
                        Mynewone users.</p>

                    <p>Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and
                        connect with people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find—or even create—your
                        home on Mynewone.</p>

                    <p>While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive),
                        no community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for
                        their members, not try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on Mynewone should have an
                        expectation of privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.</p>

                    <p>Every community on Mynewone is defined by its users. Some of these users help manage the
                        community as moderators. The culture of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community
                        rules enforced by moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its
                        community members. Please abide by the rules of communities in which you participate and do not
                        interfere with those in which you are not a member.</p>

                    <p>Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide rules that apply to everyone on
                        Mynewone. These rules are enforced by us, the admins.</p>

                    <p>Mynewone and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we
                        operate by a shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules,
                        but the spirit as well.</p>

                    <h3>RULES</h3>
                    <div class="rule">
                        <h4>RULE 1</h4>
                        <p>Remember the human. Mynewone is a place for creating community and belonging, not for
                            attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Mynewone
                            free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite
                            violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule">
                        <h4>RULE 2</h4>
                        <p>Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into communities where you have a personal
                            interest, and do not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming, vote
                            manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt
                            Mynewone communities.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule">
                        <h4>RULE 3</h4>
                        <p>Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone's
                            personal or confidential information, is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post
                            intimate or sexually-explicit media of someone without their consent.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule">
                        <h4>RULE 4</h4>
                        <p>Do not share or encourage the sharing of sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving
                            minors. Any predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor is also strictly
                            prohibited.</p>

                    <div class="rule">
                        <h4>RULE 5</h4>
                        <p>You don't have to use your real name to use Mynewone, but don't impersonate an individual or
                            an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.</p>

                        <h4>RULE 6</h4>
                        <p>Ensure people have predictable experiences on Mynewone by properly labeling content and
                            communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.</p>

                            prohibited transactions.</p>
