                    <h3>3. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES</h3>
                    <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Mynewone grants you a personal,
                        non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to: (a) install and use a copy of
                        our mobile application associated with the Services that is obtained from a legitimate
                        marketplace on a mobile device owned or controlled by you; and (b) access and use the Services.
                        We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.</p>
                    <p>Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may
                        not, without our written agreement:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the

                            or service, except as permitted under any Additional Terms (as defined below).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We are always improving our Services. This means we may add or remove features, products, or
                        functionalities; we will try to notify you beforehand, but that won't always be possible. We
                        reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any
                        time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to
                        functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to
                        time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,
                        suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.</p>
                    <p>We personalize your experience on the Services based on a variety of factors, including your
                        activity on the Services, communities you are subscribed to, and preferences you've identified
                        in your settings. Based on these and other factors, we may make recommendations to make your
                        experience on Mynewone more relevant. For more information about your content recommendations,
                        as well as a description of how you can control certain personalization options, please see our
                        Help Center.</p>

                    <h3>4. YOUR ACCOUNT AND ACCOUNT SECURITY</h3>
                    <p>To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Mynewone account (an
                        "Account") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about
                        yourself as set forth in the <a href="../index.html" style="font-weight: bold; color: #007bff">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                    <p>You are solely responsible for the information associated with your Account and anything that
                        happens related to your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and immediately
                        notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your
                        permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with your Account and
                        enable two-factor authentication. If you add your phone number to your Account and later change
                        or deactivate your phone number, make sure to update your Account information.</p>
                    <p>You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.</p>

                    <h3>5. YOUR CONTENT</h3>
                    <p>The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, audio, streams,
                        software, tools, or other materials ("Content"), including Content created with or submitted to
                        the Services by you or through your Account ("Your Content"). We take no responsibility for and
                        we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness,
                        accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.</p>
                    <p>By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights,
                        power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms.
                        Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you
                        post or share Content without all necessary rights.</p>
                    <p>You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Mynewone the following
                        license to use that Content:</p>
                    <p>When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide,
                        royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to
                        use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display
                        Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content
                        in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This
                        license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast,
                        distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with
                        Mynewone. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you
                        irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your
                        Content.</p>
                    <p>Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Mynewone or our Services that you provide to us are
                        entirely voluntary, and you agree that Mynewone may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback
                        without compensation or obligation to you.</p>
                    <p>Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole
                        discretion, delete, deem your content ineligible for monetization, or remove Your Content, at
                        any time and for any reason, including for violating these Terms, our <a href="application-rules.html" style="font-weight: bold; color: #007bff">Rules</a>, or privacy and
                        policy, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.</p>

                    <h3>6. THINGS YOU CAN NOT DO</h3>
                    <p>When using or accessing the Services, you must comply with these Terms and all applicable laws,
                        rules, and regulations. Please review <a href="application-rules.html" style="font-weight: bold; color: #007bff"></a> the Application Rules</a>, which is incorporated by this
