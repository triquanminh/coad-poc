                        Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the
                        username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the
                        content. That content and information may also be available in search results on Internet search
                        engines like Google or in responses provided by an AI chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. You should

                    <p>To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account,
                        you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services,
                        we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain
                        information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Information you provide to us</strong></p>
                    <p>We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:</p>

                            <p><strong>Personal Accounts.</strong>&nbsp;If you create an account, you must provide us
                                with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a
                                display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, creator09); a password;
                                an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and
                                third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also
                                choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book
                                to Mynewone to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes
                                your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name
                                or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple accounts, for example, to express
                                different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.</p>

                                deliver and maintain our Services, improve your experience, understand user activity,
                                personalize content and advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertising, and
                                improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information
                                about your preferred language and other settings. See our Cookie Policy for more
                                information about how Mynewone uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable

                                information on our Services, including via the Location Customization setting or by
                                associating your content with a location, or we may derive an approximate location based
                                on your IP address.</p>

                    <p><strong>Information Collected from Other Sources</strong></p>
                    <p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third
                        parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example,
                        we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including
                        advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and
                        combine it with data you have provided to us, using a common account identifier such as a hash
                        of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to
                        personalize advertisements for you by visiting the User Settings menu in your account, as
                        described in the section titled “Your Rights and Choices” below.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Linked services.</strong>&nbsp;If you authorize or link a third-party service,
                                such as an unofficial mobile app client, to access your account, we receive information
                                about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may
                                also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that
                                service. For example, if you sign in to Mynewone with a third-party identity provider,
                                that provider may share an email address with us. To learn how information is shared
                                with linked services, see “How Information About You Is Shared” below.</p>
                        </li>

                    <p><strong>Information Collected by Third Parties</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Embedded content.</strong>&nbsp;Mynewone displays some linked content in-line on
                                the Services via embeds. For example, the posts that link to YouTube or X may load the
                                linked video or tweet within Mynewone directly from those services to your device so you
                                don't have to leave Mynewone to see it. In general, we do not control how third-party
                                services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a
                                result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of
                                the service from which the content is embedded.</p>

                            <p><strong>Audience measurement.</strong>&nbsp;We partner with service providers that
                                perform audience measurement to learn demographic information about the population that
                                uses the application. To provide this demographic information, these companies collect
                                cookie information to recognize your device.</p>

                    <h3>4. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it.
                        There are five general ways we share your information.</p>
                    <p><strong>When you post and share</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>With your consent.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information about you with your
                                consent or at your direction. For example, at your direction through social sharing
                                features that allow you to share content with third party sites like Tumblr and X.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>With linked services.</strong>&nbsp;If you link your Mynewone account with a
                                third-party service, Mynewone will share the information you authorize with that
                                third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in "Your Rights and
                                Choices" below.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>With our service providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information with vendors,
                                consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry
                                out work for us. Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate
                                confidentiality and security measures. A few examples: (i) payment processors who
                                process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data and our
                                services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers
                                measure the performance of ads shown on our Services, and (iv) compliance providers who
                                help us determine your eligibility to participate in Mynewone Programs.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>To comply with the law.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information if we believe
                                disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal
                                process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national
                                security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will
                                attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response
                                to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we
                                respond to government requests.</p>

                            <p><strong>In an emergency.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information if we believe it's
                                necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                or other terms and policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of the
                                Services, ourselves, and others.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>With our affiliates.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information between and among
                                Mynewone, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under
                                common control and ownership.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information
                                about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used
                                to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been
                                upvoted without identifying who the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many
                                people saw their ad.</p>
                        </li>

                    <h3 id="childrens-privacy">5. HOW LONG WE KEEP INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we
                        need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our
                        legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and
                                email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products
                                and services without retaining this information.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with
                                other users' content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration
                                of your account or until such content is removed.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing
                                address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions
                                will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off Mynewone, as well
                                as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.</p>

                            <p>Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers
                                you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely
                                to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with
                        legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.</strong>
                                Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law
                                enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access here.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.</strong>
                                Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your
                                account in order to defend Mynewone against legal claims.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.</strong>
                                Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate
                                and fight abuse on our products and services.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from Mynewone. For example,
                        search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their
                        own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expired on Mynewone. You can read more
                        about search visibility here.</p>

                    <h3 id="storage-accessibility">6. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h3>
                        about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to
                        correction/rectification of your personal information, to opt out of certain advertising
                        practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have previously provided consent.
                        Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Mynewone does not discriminate against
                        users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Accessing and Changing Your Information.</strong> You can access your information
                                and change or correct certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page
                                for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Mynewone
                                maintains about you by following the process described here.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Deleting Your Account.</strong> You may delete your account information at any
                                time from the user preferences page. For more information, please visit our Help Center.
                                When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and
                                disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the
                                posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be
                                visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. After you submit a
                                request to delete your account, our purge script commences the deletion process within
                                90 days. After running our purge script, Mynewone will not be able to provide access to
                                deleted data. We may also retain certain information about you for legitimate business
                                purposes and/or if we believe doing so is in accordance with, or as required by, any
                                applicable law.</p>

                                understand cookies and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and
                                collection of certain information by Google Analytics via the Google Analytics Opt-out
                                Browser Add-on. You can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by Nielsen

                                from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these
